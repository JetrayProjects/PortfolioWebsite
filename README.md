#### About:

I am a double major in Computer Science and Economics graduating in December 2025. Throughout my time at Temple University I have dedicated myself into learning and creating applications with C, 
Java, Python and its extensive frameworks in contributing to my ultimate goal of improving the society.
The intersection with Economics deepens my understanding of the impact of independent decisions on the development of society.  
I did my first internship in Data Science, which opened up my world to Artificial Intelligence, that led me to be a Research Fellow in Machine Learning in the University. 
My electives focused on educating me about the rapid advancements in development and I integrated this knowledge in my projects.
My only goal in life is to contribute to the betterment of society through the knowledge and skills I develop with experiences. Recently I have developed interest in Web development.
I would like to continue my journey in the field of Artificial Intelligence or Software Development where I truly believe I can make the most impact.

Fun Fact: I can read, write and speak 4 languages including English, Hindi, Marathi and Japanese.
